==============

A hodgepodge of:

  - a basic static site generator (_builtstatic_),
  - some reusable [Sass][1] bits and pieces (_resources/sass_), and
  - source code to my [personal website][2] (everything else).

Feel free to use whatever you find useful here for your own projects.
Other than that, you're on your own, I'm afraid.
