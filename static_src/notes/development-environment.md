  <p><b>Note</b>: For reference, I'm currently running everything on an

    sorts of nerdery I do, it works for me just fine.

Setting up an Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 install
------------------------------------------

  - When installing Ubuntu on a machine that uses Secure Boot, **do not
    skip the key enrolment step on the initial reboot**. I have
    accidentally pressed _Continue_ without completing this step far too
    many times.
  - When logging in for the first time and after going through the
    welcome screen bumf, run the _Software Updater_.
  - Go through _Settings_ to see if anything needs attention.
  - Most of my environment setup is handled by [my Ansible gubbins][1],
    but there's still a few steps that need doing manually afterwards:
    - Fix a bug in the Dash to Dock Gnome Shell extension where,
      starting with an empty dock, [icons take ages to update][2] by
      manually applying a fix [available on GitHub][3] to
      <span class="os-menu-item">/usr/<wbr>share/<wbr>gnome-shell/<wbr>extensions/<wbr>ubuntu-dock\@ubuntu.com/<wbr>dash.js</span>.
    - In Firefox: install the [1Password extension][4], change the
      default search engine to DuckDuckGo, and hide all the junk from
      the new tab screen. I also sign in to my Firefox account to get my
      bookmarks and whatnot.
    - Set the terminal font to [Iosevka][5].
    - Install [JetBrains Toolbox][6] and use it to install PhpStorm.
    - Install [Steam][7].
    - Connect to any network drives.
    - Set up Livepatch.
  - Set up Windows 10 VMs in VirtualBox for cross-browser testing, and
    the occasional piss-about in Creative Cloud and Visual Studio. (See
    _Setting up Windows 10 in VirtualBox_ for more information.)

Setting up Windows 10 in VirtualBox
-----------------------------------

I mainly use Windows 10 VMs for cross-browser testing, and occasional
Creative Cloud and Visual Studio usage, so I don't spend too much time
with customisation and maintenance.

  - When installing Windows 10 from scratch, I've found allocating 50 GB
    of storage (in a dynamically-allocated virtual hard disk), 8 GB of
    memory, and four processors to be enough for my use cases.
  - Enable 3D acceleration with the maximum amount of available video
    memory allocated. However, this causes some [hardcore funkiness][8].
    Turning [transparency effects off in Windows][9] helps a little,
    but things like Photoshop are still a little funky.
  - Once the initial installation is complete and updates are installed:
    - Install the VirtualBox Guest Additions.
    - Set the screen resolution (<span class="os-menu-item">View</span>
      &rarr; <span class="os-menu-item">Virtual Screen 1</span>) to
      1600Ã—900, or the largest resolution that'll fit on-screen.
    - Install Creative Cloud. (As my little Intel NUC doesn't have that
      much video memory to spare, I'm limited to what I can do.
      Fortunately, I have Creative Cloud available on another machine to
      fall back on.)
    - Update the hosts file (<span class="os-menu-item">%SystemRoot%\\<wbr>System32\\<wbr>drivers\\<wbr>etc\\<wbr>hosts</span>)
      to access websites hosted on the host.

I only use Visual Studio for working on [FlippyWindow][10]; Microsoft
provide [evaluation development environment virtual machines][11] that
are perfect for the small amounts of Visual-Studio-ing that I do.
(Microsoft also provide [virtual machines][12] for testing websites in
Internet Explorer 11 and Edge Legacy.)
