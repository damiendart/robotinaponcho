    Current brushes of choice
    -------------------------

    From Kyle T Webster's Megapack:

      - For line art, _Kyle's Inkbox - Badass Brush_ at 35 pixels.
      - For colouring, _Kyle's Inkbox - Roughest Ink No Alias_ at 40 pixels.

    The brush sizes assume a document with a resolution of 300 DPI.


    Converting pencil artwork to non-repro blue
    -------------------------------------------

      1. Open up the scanned pencil artwork in Photoshop and use a _Levels_
         adjustment layer to improve the line quality and whites.
      2. Clean up the artwork with white on a separate layer, if necessary.
      3. Convert the image to grayscale (using the _Mode_ menu found in the
         _Image_ menu) and then to monotone using 20% cyan as the primary
         ink. The shade of cyan used might depend on personal preference
         and printer output.


    Cleaning up line art
    --------------------

      1. Clean up the scanned line art in Photoshop with adjustment layers:
         -  Remove any non-repro blue underdrawings with a _Hue/Saturation_
            adjustment layer. After choosing the _Cyans_ colour range in the
            _Properties_ panel, set the saturation to minimimum and
            lightness to maximum.
         -  Use _Curves_ and/or _Levels_ adjustment layers to improve the
            line quality and whites, and remove any remaining underdrawings.
         -  For inked line art, use a _Threshold_ adjustment layer to
            convert the line art to black-and-white bitmap.
      2. At the bottom of the _Channels_ palette, click on _Load channel as
         selection_ to create a selection of the white areas of the image.
      3. Invert the selection.
      4. Create a fill layer; the selection will be applied to the fill
         layer's mask. Alternatively, use the _Paint Bucket_ tool to fill
         the selection on a new layer.
      5. Deselect the selection.
      6. Delete or hide the scanned artwork and adjustment layers.


    Image filesize reduction techniques
    -----------------------------------

      - Use [ExifTool][3] and [jpegtran][3] to reduce JPEG image filesizes:
        `jpegtran -optimize -progressive [IMAGE] > [OUTPUT] &&
        exiftool -all= --icc_profile:all [OUTPUT]`.
