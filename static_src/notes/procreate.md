Current brushes of choice
-------------------------

  - Stock _Tinderbox_ (Inking) for general inking and colouring in.
  - Stock _Little Pine_ (Drawing) for pencil-y type stuff.
  - For colouring in and erasing, take the stock _Dry Ink_ (Inking)
    brush and remove the grain (by setting the _Grain Source_ to the
    blank image from the _Source Library_).
