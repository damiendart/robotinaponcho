Current brushes of choice
-------------------------

Assuming a document set to 600 DPI, I use:

  - the stock _Wild Light_ (Artistic) for inking;
  - the stock _Little Pine_ (Drawing) for under-drawings; and
  - for erasing, take the stock _Dry Ink_ (Inking) brush and remove the
    grain (set the _Grain Source_ to the blank image from the _Source
    Library_).

I stick with the default brush sizes and opacity, except for the custom
eraser brush. I also use the custom eraser brush to do a little
colouring in when I can't be bothered to use [Photoshop][1].
