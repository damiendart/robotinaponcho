    Setting up a Synology DiskStation
    ---------------------------------

      - Ensure the DiskStation is given a static IP.
      - Instead of using the default _admin_ account, create a new user and
        give them admin privileges, then disable both the default _admin_
        and any guest accounts.
      - Enable SMB 3 in the _File Services_ control panel in DSM.
      - Hide the _homes_ shared folder in "My Network Places" by setting the
        adforementioned option in the _Shared Folder_ control panel in DSM.
        This is purely for aesthetic purposes.
      - Go through the _Security_ control panel in DSM. (Check the control
        panel on a regular basis for new features.)
      - When creating folders, remember to set reasonable permissions.
      - Use rsync to transfer files. If using a different copying method,
        rsync's dry-run mode with the `c` flag can be used to check
        everything has copied correctly.
      - Run the _Security Advisor_ to see if anything else needs attention,
        and enable the regular scan schedule to perform a weekly scan.
      - Make sure daily backup stuff (S3, external hard-drive) is set up.
      - Git from the _Package Center_ in DSM craps out whenever you tried to
        do anything via HTTPS. Fortunately, the [solution is simple][3]:
        download [a recent CA Root certificate bundle][4] to your
        DiskStation and point Git to it by setting `http.sslCAinfo` to the
        location of that file in your global or system-wide _.gitignore_.
      - Set up custom scheduled tasks.
        - Use [getmail][5] to backup email every three hours.
        - Use [mirrorgithub][6] to backup public GitHub repositories daily.
        - Use [pinboardbackup][7] to backup Pinboard bookmarks daily.
        - Even with NTP synchronisation enabled in DSM's _Regional Options_
          control panel the date and time will occasionally get out of sync.
          Creating a daily scheduled task to run the `ntpdate -u -b
          [SOME-NTP-SERVER]` command as root seems to keep things in check.
        - Daily and weekly scheduled tasks should be run at night.
      - Manually downloaded Python packages are regularly removed as part of
        some updates, so when reinstalling save time by keeping any source
        code in _~/src_ or any easily reachable folder.
      - When setting up DNS-O-Matic DDNS support in the _External Access_
        control panel, use `all.dnsomatic.com` for the hostname and replace
        any `@` characters in the username with `%30`.
      - If using _File Station_'s shared links functionality, ensure the
        _Advanced_ tab in the _External Access_ control panel is filled out
        so that correct URLs are generated.
      - Enable bad sector and disk lifespan warnings in _Storage Manager_.

    Miscellaneous things
    --------------------

      - The _Task Scheduler_ control panel in DSM doesn't tell you whether a
        task's last run failed or succeeded.  Running the command
        `synoschedtask --get` provides detailed information about tasks,
        including their last run statuses.
      - Extracting _tar.gz_ files with tar: `tar -zxvf [FILENAME]` (I'm
        always forgetting the combination of flags).
