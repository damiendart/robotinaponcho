        ## Frequently asked questions

        ### Can't I just use any image editor to do what FlippyWindow does?

        As far as I'm aware, [Adobe Photoshop CC 2019][1] (and later), [Clip
        Paint Studio][2], [Krita][3], and [PaintTool SAI][4] have features
        that allow you to non-destructively change how you view an image. I
        built FlippyWindow at a time when the applications I was using lacked
        such a feature, and the crappy laptop I was using didn't take too
        kindly to repeatedly flipping large images. (Plus I was curious to see
        if making something like FlippyWindow was possible.)

        [3]: <https://krita.org/>
        [4]: <https://www.systemax.jp/en/sai/>
        [5]: <https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html>

        FlippyWindow can also help you spot visual issues in work outside of
        image editors, including animations, application user interfaces, and
        website designs.

        ### What is itch.io?

        [itch.io][6] describes itself as "an open marketplace for independent
        digital creators". It allows me to offer FlippyWindow with
        pay-what-you-want pricing.

        If you want to support FlippyWindow and anything else I make, please
        consider naming your price before downloading. This is completely
        optional; you can download FlippyWindow without paying or signing up
        to anything.

        ### Will earlier versions of Windows, Linux and macOS be supported?

        FlippyWindow uses APIs (specifically the second release of the
        Magnification API) that were introduced in Windows 8. At the moment
        there are no plans to rewrite FlippyWindow to support earlier versions
        of Windows and other operating systems.
