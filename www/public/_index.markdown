Damien Dart's Homepage
======================

**Hello!** I'm [Damien Dart][1] and I make things, mainly involving
computers and illustration. I occasionally do a bit of freelance
work, so please [get in touch][2] if you have a project I can help with.

## Programming Projects

  - [nfsnapi-python][2] is a simple Python package that makes the
    NearlyFreeSpeech.NET API a little easier to use.
  - I've written a simple [brainfuck interpreter in C][3], which
    includes an embeddable library (because reasons).
  - The [source code to this site][4] is also available.

There's more available in [my Git repositories][5] and on [GitHub][6].

## Web Design and Development

As well as my personal site, I've built a few other websites:

  - [Kathryn Craigdaillie Designs][7], a design portfolio website; and
  - [Radical Apps][8], a mobile app showcase website.

## Miscellaneous Things and Elsewhere

  - I've written notes on [maintaining a Synology DiskStation][9] and
    some [Photoshop techniques I often use][10].
  - Other places I've polluted: [Instagram][11], [Tumblr][12], and
    [Twitter][13].
