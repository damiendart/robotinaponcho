**Hi! I'm Damien Dart.**

  - I have a bunch of nerdy things up on [GitHub][1] (and [mirrored here][2]).
  - I put dumb drawings and paintings up on [Tumblr][3] and [Instagram][4].
  - I have a [folder of crap][5] for random bits and pieces.
  - Other places I've polluted: [Twitter][6].
  - Here's an [email address][7].

I'll make a better-looking homepage tomorrow.
