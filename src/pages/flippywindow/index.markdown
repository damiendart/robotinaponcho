## Frequently asked questions

### Can't I just use any image editor to do what FlippyWindow does?

As far as I'm aware, [Clip Paint Studio][1], [Krita][2], and [PaintTool
SAI][3] have features that allow you to non-destructively change how you
view an image. I built FlippyWindow because I use Adobe's [Creative
Cloud suite][4] which lacks such features.

FlippyWindow can also help you spot visual issues in work outside of
image editors, including animations, application user interfaces, and
website designs.

### What is itch.io?

[itch.io][5] describes itself as "an open marketplace for independent
digital creators". It allows me to offer FlippyWindow with
pay-what-you-want pricing.

If you want to support future development of FlippyWindow--[I have a few
things planned][6]--and anything else I make, please consider naming
your price before downloading. This is completely optional; you can
download FlippyWindow without paying or signing up to anything.

### Will earlier versions of Windows, Linux and macOS be supported?

FlippyWindow uses APIs (specifically the second release of the
Magnification API) that were introduced in Windows 8. At the moment
there are no plans to rewrite FlippyWindow to support earlier versions
of Windows and other operating systems.
