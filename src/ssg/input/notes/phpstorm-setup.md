My PhpStorm Customisations and Settings
=======================================

Maybe one day I’ll get round to using a [settings repository][], but for
the moment going through this list with a fresh installation of PhpStorm
takes a couple of minutes, so eh.

**Note**: The search functionality in PhpStorm’s *Settings* window is
pretty good, so I haven’t included the whole hierarchy of menus you need
to drill down to find a particular setting. Use the setting name
formatted in *italics* as the search term.

  [settings repository]: <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/settings-tools-settings-repository.html>


## Plugins

In addition to the plugins that come bundled with PhpStorm, I also use
[IdeaVim][] (because I’m one of those people), [Key Promoter X][], and
[Laravel Idea][].

  [IdeaVim]: <https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim>
  [Key Promoter X]: <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x>
  [Laravel Idea]: <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13441-laravel-idea>


## Removing as much of the interface as possible

I’m also one of these people.

- Turn on *Use contrast scrollbars*.
- Turn on *Use smaller indents in trees*.
- Turn off *Show tool window bars*.
- Right-click the status bar and turn on the *Memory Indicator*.
- Turn off *Display icons in menu items*.
- Turn on *Widescreen tool window layout* (where appropriate).
- Remove tabs completely (set *Tab Placement* to *None*) and instead
  rely on <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> to switch between recent files.
- Turn off *Show browsers popup in the editor*.
- Hide the navigation bar (<span class="os-menu-item">View</span> →
  <span class="os-menu-item">Appearance</span> →
  <span class="os-menu-item">Navigation Bar</span>).

If using the New UI Beta:

- Turn on *Compact mode*.


## IdeaVim customisations and settings

- Ensure that the *.ideavimrc* configuration file from [my dotfiles][]
  is installed.
- On macOS, make IdeaVim a more pleasant experience by running
  `defaults write com.jetbrains.PhpStorm ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`
  in the terminal.

## Miscellaneous customisations and settings

- Check that PhpStorm is aware of all available PHP CLI interpreters in
  *Languages & Frameworks* → *PHP* in the *Settings* window.
- Set the IDE theme to Darcula or Dark, depending on whether you’re
  using the existing UI or the New UI Beta.
- Set the editor font to [Iosekva][] Term.
- Set default visual guides at 72 and 78 characters.
- Set the *Project Opening*’s *Default directory*.
