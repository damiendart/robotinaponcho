Cleaning Up Scanned Line Art in Adobe Photoshop
===============================================

1.  Use adjustment layers to begin cleaning up your line art:
    - Remove any non-repro blue underdrawings with a *Hue/Saturation*
      adjustment layer. After choosing the *Cyans* colour range in the
      *Properties* panel, set the saturation to minimum and lightness to
      maximum.
    - Use *Curves* and/or *Levels* adjustment layers to improve the line
      quality and whites, and remove any remaining underdrawings.
    - For inked line art, use a *Threshold* adjustment layer to convert
      the line art to black-and-white bitmap.
2.  At the bottom of the *Channels* palette, click on *Load channel as
    selection* to create a selection of the white areas of the image.
3.  Invert the selection.
4.  Create a fill layer; the selection will be applied to the fill
    layerâ€™s mask. Alternatively, use the *Paint Bucket* tool to fill the
    selection on a new layer.
5.  Deselect the selection.
6.  Delete or hide the scanned artwork and adjustment layers.
