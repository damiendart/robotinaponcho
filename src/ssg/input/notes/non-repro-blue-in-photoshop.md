Converting Pencil Artwork to Non-Repro Blue in Adobe Photoshop
==============================================================

1.  Use a *Levels* adjustment layer to improve the line quality and
    whites of your scanned pencil artwork.
2.  Clean up the artwork with white on a separate layer, if necessary.
3.  Convert the image to grayscale (using the *Mode* menu found in the
    *Image* menu) and then to monotone using 20% cyan as the primary
    ink. The shade of cyan used might depend on personal preference and
    printer output.
