A Basic White Loaf Recipe
=========================

When I feel like baking something this will create a decent loaf without
too much faff.


## Ingredients

| Ingredient               | [Baker’s Percentage][] | Example |
|:-------------------------|:----------------------:|:-------:|
| Strong white bread flour |          100%          |  500 g  |
| Tepid water              |          60%           | 300 ml  |
| A sachet of dried yeast  |          1.4%          |   7 g   |
| Fine salt                |           2%           |  10 g   |
| Olive oil                |           2%           |  10 ml  |

You’ll also need a little extra olive oil for coating the proofing
vessel.

## Method

1.  Chuck everything into a stand mixer set up with a dough hook and
    knead on medium speed for two minutes. Increase the speed by a notch
    and continue kneading for three minutes.
2.  Take the dough out, lightly oil the stand mixer bowl, and plop the
    dough back in. Use the oil to coat the dough to prevent it from
    drying out. Cover the bowl with cling film or a towel and let the
    dough rise until it has doubled in size (if time allows, this can be
    done overnight in the fridge).
3.  Empty the bowl onto a lightly-dusted surface and knead the dough for
    a minute.
4.  Put the dough in a lightly-floured loaf tin and cover with a tea
    towel. Let the dough prove again until it has doubled in size.
5.  While the dough is proving for a second time, whack the oven on as
    high it’ll go with a pizza stone, if you have one, and an empty loaf
    tin on the middle shelf.
6.  When the dough is ready to be baked, add your toppings and make a
    few cuts on the top with a bread knife. Boil some water.
7.  Working quickly, place your dough onto the pizza stone and pour the
    boiling water into the empty loaf tin. Close the oven and let the
    bread bake for 10 minutes before turning the oven temperature down
    to 180 °C (assuming a fan-assisted oven) and continuing to bake for
    another 35 minutes.
8.  Transfer the loaf to a wire rack to cool.
