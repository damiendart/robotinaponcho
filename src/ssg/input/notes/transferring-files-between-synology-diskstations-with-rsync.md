Transferring Files Between Synology DiskStations with rsync
===========================================================

On the old device, enable the rsync service in the *File Services*
control panel in the DiskStation Manager (DSM).

Log into the new device via SSH and run a big ol’ rsync command:

``` shell
$ rsync --exclude '.DS_Store' --exclude '@eaDir' --exclude 'desktop.ini' -avhPc [SRC] [DEST] |& tee /tmp/rsync-output.txt
```

**Note:** When using the `-a` flag, you might get a “some files/attrs
were not transferred” error at the end. This may be due to group or
owner attribute inconsistencies between the two machines. To check,
review the rsync output or perform a dry-run transfer. Alternatively,
[replace the `-a` flag][] before running the rsync command.

After everything has been transferred over, you might need to clean up
any group, owner, or permission issues. (I’ve used [an approach from the
Synology knowledge base][], but it’s pretty heavy-handed.)
