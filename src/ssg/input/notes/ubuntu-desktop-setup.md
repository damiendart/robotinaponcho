Setting Up an Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 Install
==========================================

For reference, I’m currently using an [Intel NUC10i7FNH][] with 32 GB of
RAM.

## Operating system installation and the first five minutes

-   When installing Ubuntu on a machine that uses Secure Boot, **do not
    skip the key enrolment step on the initial reboot**. I have
    accidentally pressed *Continue* without completing this step far too
    many times.
-   After going through the welcome screen bumf, I tend to run the
    *Software Updater* and go through *Settings*. (I am cursed with
    being incapable of using any new thing unless I’ve thoroughly
    scoured its options and settings.)
-   Set up and run the provisioning Ansible playbook available from [my
    Ansible gubbins][].

## Post-Ansible checklist and tasks

While most of my machine provisioning is handled by Ansible, I haven’t
managed to automate everything:

-   Fix [a bug in the Dash to Dock GNOME Shell extension][] that causes
    icons to take ages to update when you start with an empty dock by
    manually applying [a fix available on GitHub][] to
    <span class="os-menu-item">/usr/<wbr>share/<wbr>gnome-shell/<wbr>extensions/<wbr>ubuntu-dock@ubuntu.com/<wbr>dash.js</span>.
-   In Firefox: install the [1Password extension][], change the default
    search engine to DuckDuckGo, and hide all the junk from the new tab
    screen. I also sign in to my Mozilla account to enable syncing
    gubbins.
-   Set the font used in Gnome Terminal to [Iosevka][] Term.
-   Install [JetBrains Toolbox][] and use it to install GoLand,
    DataGrip, and [PhpStorm][].
-   Install [Steam][].
-   Connect to any network drives.
-   Set up Syncthing and [Obsidian][].
-   Set up some Windows 10 VMs in VirtualBox for cross-browser testing
    and light Visual Studio usage.
    -   Microsoft provide [evaluation development environment virtual
        machines][] that are perfect for how often I need to use
        Windows.
    -   Update the hosts file
        (<span class="os-menu-item">%SystemRoot%\\<wbr>System32\\<wbr>drivers\\<wbr>etc\\<wbr>hosts</span>)
        to be able to [access websites and other network services on the
        host][].
