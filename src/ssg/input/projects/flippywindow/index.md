## Frequently asked questions

### Can’t I just use any image editor to do what FlippyWindow does?

Last time I looked, [Adobe Photoshop CC 2019][] (and later), [Clip Paint
Studio][], [Krita][], and [PaintTool SAI][] have features that allow you
to non-destructively change how you view an image, so chances are
FlippyWindow isn’t necessary.

I built FlippyWindow mainly to see if something like it was possible.
Also, at the time I had a crappy laptop and FlippyWindow made checking
large images considerably less painful than using Photoshop to flip them
back-and-forth.

FlippyWindow can also help you spot visual issues in work outside of
image editors, including animations, application user interfaces, and
website designs.

### Is FlippyWindow available elsewhere?

You can also download FlippyWindow from [itch.io][].

If you want to support FlippyWindow and anything else I make, please
consider naming your price before downloading. This is completely
optional; you can download FlippyWindow without paying or signing up to
anything.

[SHA-256 checksums][] are available to verify the archive downloads
(either from here or itch.io).

FlippyWindow’s source code is licenced under [the MIT licence][] and is
available on [my personal site][] and [GitHub][].

### Will earlier versions of Windows, Linux and macOS be supported?

FlippyWindow (ab)uses APIs that were introduced in Windows 8
(specifically the second release of the Magnification API).

FlippyWindow works on the operating systems I use, so there are no plans
to investigate whether FlippyWindow can support earlier versions of
Windows and other operating systems.

For users using 32-bit versions of Windows, [a 32-bit version of
FlippyWindow is available to download][].
