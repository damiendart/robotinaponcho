## Frequently asked questions

### Can’t I just use any image editor to do what FlippyWindow does?

Probably! I wrote FlippyWindow back when I was using a version of Adobe
Photoshop where the only way of viewing your work flipped was to
transform it back-and-forth, which was especially painful with large
documents. Since then, most of the image editors I’ve used (including
Photoshop) have a way of non-destructively viewing your work flipped.

FlippyWindow can also help you spot visual issues in work outside of
image editors, including animations, application user interfaces, and
website designs.

### Is FlippyWindow available elsewhere?

You can also download FlippyWindow from [itch.io][].

If you want to support FlippyWindow and anything else I make, please
consider naming your price before downloading. This is completely
optional; you can download FlippyWindow without paying or signing up to
anything.

[SHA-256 checksums][] are available to verify the archive downloads
(either from here or itch.io).

### Will earlier versions of Windows, Linux and macOS be supported?

FlippyWindow (ab)uses APIs that were introduced in Windows 8,
specifically the second release of the Magnification API.

FlippyWindow works on the operating systems I use, so there are no plans
to investigate whether FlippyWindow can support earlier versions of
Windows and other operating systems.

For users using 32-bit versions of Windows, [a 32-bit version of
FlippyWindow is available to download][].
