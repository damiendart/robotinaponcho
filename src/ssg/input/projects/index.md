## Drawing and writing

- Sometimes I [doodle and draw], and write [notes on stuff].
- During a [lengthy period of staying at home], I started drawing some
  colouring pages with the idea of turning it into a regularly-updated
  thing. I lost interest after five pages. They’re [still available
  online].

## Open-source software

My open-source software is available as Git repositories, either from
[GitHub] or [my self-hosted mirrors].

**[brainfuck]**
:   A simple [brainfuck][1] interpreter written in C.

**[FlippyWindow]**
:   A simple Windows application that non-destructively flips any part
    of your screen horizontally.

**[kew]**
:   A *very* basic background task queue, written in PHP.

**[My solutions to the Advent of Code]**
:   So far there’s solutions to half of the [2021 Advent of Code]
    (written in Go). Maybe one day I will actually complete a year.

**[nt]**
:   A personal note-taking helper command-line application.

**[pathshorten]**
:   An implementation of Vim’s [`pathshorten`] function written in Go.

**[robotinaponcho]**
:   The source code to my personal site (you’re on it now).

**[setup]**
:   A bunch of (mostly) Ansible stuff for provisioning and maintaining
    various machines and things, including personal and work development
    environments, and a couple of servers for hosting small websites.

**[snippets]**
:   A repository of code and text snippets.

**[Time Tracker]**
:   A Vue-based time tracker.

**[toolbox]**
:   Dotfiles and small scripts that don’t warrant their own repository.

### Abandoned and deprecated projects

**[Bastard Snake]**
:   Written in Haxe, Bastard Snake set out to be a Snake clone that
    didn’t like you getting many points, but only got as far as making
    collecting points slightly inconvenient.

**[knr-solutions]**
:   My incomplete set of solutions to the exercises in *The C
    Programming Language (Second Edition)*.

**[nfsnapi-python]**
:   When I used to use [NearlyFreeSpeech.NET], I wrote a simple Python
    package that made using their API a little easier. (Be aware that I
    wrote this during my
    *cram-as-much-shit-into-as-few-lines-as-possible* phase.)

**[notes]**
:   Various notes on stuff. These notes have since been merged into my
    personal website repository, where I continue to update them.

**[obtaincornhoop]**
:   Back when I had a Tumblr weblog, I created a custom theme for it.
    The name is an anagram of “robot in a poncho”.

**[Timeline]**
:   A Laravel web application for displaying and maintaining a timeline,
    kinda like the one at [JetBrains’ 25 Years of PHP History]. I lost
    interest in tinkering with this in my spare time when I started
    writing a similar internal application for work.

**[toolbox-sass]**
:   A library of web-development-related stuff. I took the best bits and
    added them to my general-purpose snippet library instead. The name
    was getting increasingly inaccurate, too.

**[yassg]**
:   Yet another static site generator, written in PHP. Initially written
    just for my personal site, I had a go at turning it into something
    others could use. I lost interest and went back to a simpler, more
    opinionated generator.

### Contributions to other projects
