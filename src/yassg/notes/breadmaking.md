## My current good-enough white loaf recipe

This recipe won’t produce anything award-winning, but when I feel like
baking this will create a decent loaf without too much faff.

### Ingredients

| Ingredient               | [Baker’s Percentage][] | Example |
|:-------------------------|:----------------------:|:-------:|
| Strong white bread flour |          100%          |  500 g  |
| Tepid water              |          60%           | 300 ml  |
| A sachet of dried yeast  |          1.4%          |   7 g   |
| Fine salt                |           2%           |  10 g   |
| Olive oil                |           2%           |  10 ml  |

You’ll also need a little extra olive oil for coating your proofing
vessel.

### Method

1.  Chuck everything into a stand mixer set up with a dough hook and
    knead on a medium speed for two minutes. Increase the speed a notch
    and knead for an additional three minutes.
2.  Take the dough out, lightly oil the stand mixer bowl, and plop the
    dough back in. Use the oil to coat the dough to prevent it from
    drying out. Cover the bowl with cling film or a towel and let the
    dough rise until it has doubled in size (this can be done overnight
    in the fridge if time allows).
3.  Empty the bowl onto a lightly-dusted surface and knead the dough for
    a minute.
4.  Shape the dough as required (I put mine in a lightly-floured loaf
    tin). Cover with a tea towel and let it prove until it has doubled
    in size.
5.  While the dough is proving for a second time, whack the oven on as
    high it’ll go with a pizza stone, if you have one, and an empty loaf
    tin on the middle shelf.
6.  When the dough is ready to be baked, add your toppings and make a
    few cuts on the top with a bread knife. Boil some water.
7.  Working quickly, place your dough onto the pizza stone and pour the
    boiling water into the empty loaf tin. Close the oven and let the
    bread bake for 10 minutes before turning the oven temperature down
    to 180 °C and continuing to bake for another 35 minutes.
8.  Transfer the loaf to a wire rack to cool.
