Getting More Information About Scheduled Tasks on Synology DiskStations
=======================================================================

The *Task Scheduler* control panel in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM)
doesn’t tell you whether a task’s last run was successful or not.

Logging into your device via SSH and running the command
`synoschedtask --get` provides detailed information about tasks,
including their last run statuses.
