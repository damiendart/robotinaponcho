My Current Procreate Brushes of Choice
======================================

Assuming a document set to 600 DPI, I use:

- the stock *Wild Light* (Artistic) for inking;
- the stock *Little Pine* (Drawing) for underdrawings; and
- for erasing, take the stock *Dry Ink* (Inking) brush and remove the
  grain (set the *Grain Source* to the blank image from the *Source
  Library*).

I don’t mess with brush sizes and opacity unless I’m erasing.

I sometimes use the custom eraser brush to do a little colouring in, but
I tend to use [Photoshop][] to colour in final pieces because I am no
good at picking colours and Photoshop’s fill layers are a god-send for
me when it comes to changing and trying out colours.
