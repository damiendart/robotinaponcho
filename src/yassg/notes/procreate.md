Current brushes of choice
-------------------------

Assuming a document set to 600 DPI, I use:

  - the stock _Wild Light_ (Artistic) for inking;
  - the stock _Little Pine_ (Drawing) for underdrawings; and
  - for erasing, take the stock _Dry Ink_ (Inking) brush and remove the
    grain (set the _Grain Source_ to the blank image from the _Source
    Library_).

I don't mess with brush sizes and opacity unless I'm erasing.

I sometimes use the custom eraser brush to do a little colouring in, but
I tend to use [Photoshop][1] to colour in final pieces because I am no
good at picking colours and Photoshop's fill layers are a god-send for
me when it comes to changing and trying out colours.
