        ## Frequently asked questions

        ### Can’t I just use any image editor to do what FlippyWindow does?

        As far as I’m aware, [Adobe Photoshop CC 2019][] (and later), [Clip
        Paint Studio][], [Krita][], and [PaintTool SAI][] have features that
        allow you to non-destructively change how you view an image. I built
        FlippyWindow at a time when the applications I was using lacked such a
        feature, and the crappy laptop I had wasn't loving having to repeatedly
        flip large images the old-fashioned way.

        Plus, I was curious to see if making something like FlippyWindow was
        possible.

        FlippyWindow can also help you spot visual issues in work outside of
        image editors, including animations, application user interfaces, and
        website designs.

          [PaintTool SAI]: <https://www.systemax.jp/en/sai/>

        ### What is itch.io?

        [itch.io][] describes itself as “an open marketplace for independent
        digital creators”. It allows me to offer FlippyWindow with
        pay-what-you-want pricing.

        If you want to support FlippyWindow and anything else I make, please
        consider naming your price before downloading. This is completely
        optional; you can download FlippyWindow without paying or signing up to
        anything.

          [itch.io]: <https://itch.io/>

        <h3 id="alternative-download-locations">Is FlippyWindow available elsewhere?</h3>

        You can download FlippyWindow from this website:

        - [Download a ZIP archive containing a 32-bit binary of FlippyWindow][].
        - [Download a ZIP archive containing a 64-bit binary of FlippyWindow][].

        If you are unsure which archive to download, the 64-bit version is
        usually your best bet. [SHA-256 checksums][] are also available to
        verify the archive downloads (either from here or itch.io).

          [Download a ZIP archive containing a 32-bit binary of FlippyWindow]: <https://www.robotinaponcho.net/projects/flippywindow/flippywindow-32-bit.zip>
          [Download a ZIP archive containing a 64-bit binary of FlippyWindow]: <https://www.robotinaponcho.net/projects/flippywindow/flippywindow-64-bit.zip>
          [SHA-256 checksums]: <https://www.robotinaponcho.net/projects/flippywindow/flippywindow-checksums.txt>

        ### Will earlier versions of Windows, Linux and macOS be supported?

        FlippyWindow uses APIs that were introduced in Windows 8 (specifically
        the second release of the Magnification API). At the moment there are
        no plans to rewrite FlippyWindow to support earlier versions of Windows
        and other operating systems.
