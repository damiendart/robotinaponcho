Here are some things that I’ve created. Most of my open-source code can
be found on [GitHub][] (which is also [mirrored here][]).

-   **[brainfuck][]**: A simple [brainfuck][1] interpreter written in C.
-   **[FlippyWindow][]**: A simple Windows application that
    non-destructively flips any part of your screen horizontally.
-   **[My solutions to the Advent of Code][]**
-   **[pathshorten][]**: An implementation of Vim’s [`pathshorten`][]
    function written in Go.
-   **[robotinaponcho][]**: The source code to my personal site (you’re
    on it now).
-   **[setup][]**: A bunch of (mostly) Ansible stuff I use to set up
    various things.
-   **[Timeline][]**: A Laravel-powered web application for displaying
    and maintaining a timeline, kinda like the one at [JetBrains’ 25
    Years of PHP History][].
-   **[Time Tracker][]**: A Vue-based time tracker.
-   **[toolbox][]**: Dotfiles and small scripts that don’t warrant their
    own repository.
-   **[toolbox-sass][]**: A hodgepodge of web-development-related stuff.
-   **[yassg][]**: Yet another static site generator, written in PHP.

I also have a folder of [random crap][] that I use for odds-and-sods I
want to publish but don’t warrant their own page.

## Contributions to other projects

-   I’ve had [few small pull-requests][] accepted into [Kirby][], a
    file-based PHP CMS.
-   I’ve contributed a [couple][] of CLI bug-fixes to [HTMLMinifier][],
    a JavaScript-based HTML minifier.

## Abandoned, completed or deprecated projects

-   **[Bastard Snake][]**: Written in Haxe, Bastard Snake set out to be
    a Snake clone that didn’t like you getting many points, but only got
    as far as making collecting points slightly inconvenient.
-   **[knr-solutions][]**: My incomplete set of solutions to the
    exercises in *The C Programming Language (Second Edition)*.
-   **[nfsnapi-python][]**: When I used NearlyFreeSpeech.NET to host
    websites, I wrote a simple Python package that made using their API
    a little easier. (Be aware that I wrote this during my
    *cram-as-much-shit-into-as-few-lines-as-possible* phase.)
-   **[notes][]**: Notes on stuff. These notes have since been merged
    into my personal website repository, where I continue to update
    them.
-   **[obtaincornhoop][]**: I once had a Tumblr weblog; this was the
    theme I made for it.
