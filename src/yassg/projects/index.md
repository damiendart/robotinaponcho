## Drawing and writing

- Sometimes I [doodle and draw][], and write [notes on stuff][].
- During a [lengthy period of staying at home][], I started drawing some
  colouring pages with the idea of turning it into a regularly-updated
  thing. I lost interest after five pages. They’re [still available
  online][].

## Open-source software

My open-source software is available as Git repositories, either from
[GitHub][] or [my self-hosted mirrors][].

**[brainfuck][]**
:   A simple [brainfuck][1] interpreter written in C.

**[FlippyWindow][]**
:   A simple Windows application that non-destructively flips any part
    of your screen horizontally.

**[My solutions to the Advent of Code][]**
:   Incomplete.

**[pathshorten][]**
:   An implementation of Vim’s [`pathshorten`][] function written in Go.

**[robotinaponcho][]**
:   The source code to my personal site (you’re on it now).

**[setup][]**
:   A bunch of (mostly) Ansible stuff I use to set up various things.

**[snippets][]**
:   A repository of code and text snippets.

**[Time Tracker][]**
:   A Vue-based time tracker.

**[toolbox][]**
:   Dotfiles and small scripts that don’t warrant their own repository.

**[yassg][]**
:   Yet another static site generator, written in PHP.

### Abandoned, completed or deprecated projects

**[Bastard Snake][]**
:   Written in Haxe, Bastard Snake set out to be a Snake clone that
    didn’t like you getting many points, but only got as far as making
    collecting points slightly inconvenient. <span
    class="pill">Abandoned<span
    class="screen-reader-only">.</span></span>

**[knr-solutions][]**
:   My incomplete set of solutions to the exercises in *The C
    Programming Language (Second Edition)*. <span
    class="pill">Abandoned<span
    class="screen-reader-only">.</span></span>

**[nfsnapi-python][]**
:   When I used NearlyFreeSpeech.NET to host websites, I wrote a simple
    Python package that made using their API a little easier. (Be aware
    that I wrote this during my
    *cram-as-much-shit-into-as-few-lines-as-possible* phase.) <span
    class="pill">Abandoned<span
    class="screen-reader-only">.</span></span>

**[notes][]**
:   Various notes on stuff. These notes have since been merged into my
    personal website repository, where I continue to update them. <span
    class="pill">Deprecated<span
    class="screen-reader-only">.</span></span>

**[Timeline][]**
:   A Laravel web application for displaying and maintaining a timeline,
    kinda like the one at [JetBrains’ 25 Years of PHP History][]. I lost
    interest in tinkering with this in my spare time when I started
    writing a similar internal application for work. <span
    class="pill">Abandoned<span
    class="screen-reader-only">.</span></span>

**[toolbox-sass][]**
:   A library of web-development-related stuff. I took the best bits and
    added them to my general-purpose snippet library instead. The name
    was getting increasingly inaccurate, too. <span
    class="pill">Deprecated<span
    class="screen-reader-only">.</span></span>

**[obtaincornhoop][]**
:   Back when I had a Tumblr weblog, I created a custom theme for it.
    The name is an anagram of “robot in a poncho”. <span
    class="pill">Completed?<span
    class="screen-reader-only">.</span></span>
