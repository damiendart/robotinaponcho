The Folder of Crap
==================

This is a collection of random bits and pieces that I can't be bothered
finding a proper home for. Don't expect much.

  - Some notes on [maintaining a Synology DiskStation][1] and
    [Photoshop techniques I often use][2].
  - [A *really* old Flash version][3] of [Bastard Snake][4].
  - [A TeamSpeak server banner][5] that I should really take down.
  - [Trevor the alien][6].
