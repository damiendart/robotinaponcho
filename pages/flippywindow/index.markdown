## Frequently asked questions

### Can't I just use any image editor to do what FlippyWindow does? 

As far as I'm aware, [Clip Paint Studio][6], [Krita][7], and [PaintTool
SAI][8] have features that allow you to non-destructively change how you
view an image. I built FlippyWindow because I use Adobe's [Creative
Cloud suite][9] which lacks such features.

[7]: <https://krita.org/>

[9]: <https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html>

FlippyWindow can also help you spot visual issues in work outside of
image editors, including animations, application user interfaces, and
website designs.

### Will Linux and macOS be supported?

Not at the moment.
