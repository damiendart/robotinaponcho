## Frequently asked questions

### Can't I just use any image editor to do what FlippyWindow does? 

As far as I'm aware, [Clip Paint Studio][6], [Krita][7], and [PaintTool
SAI][8] have features that allow you to non-destructively change how you
view an image. I built FlippyWindow because I use Adobe's [Creative
Cloud suite][9] which lacks such features.

FlippyWindow can also help you spot visual issues in work outside of
image editors, including animations, application user interfaces, and
website designs.

### What is itch.io?

[itch.io][10] describes itself as "an open marketplace for independent
digital creators". It allows me to offer FlippyWindow with
pay-what-you-want pricing.

If you want to support future development of FlippyWindow--[I have a few
things planned][11]--and anything else I make, please consider naming
your price before downloading. This is completely optional; you can
download FlippyWindow without paying or signing up to anything.
