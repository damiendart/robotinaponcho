# FlippyWindow

<div class="blurb blurb--image"><img src="flippywindow.png"></div>

FlippyWindow is a simple Windows application that non-destructively
flips any part of your screen horizontally, in realtime and using
minimal resources.

Flipping images (or viewing things with a mirror) is a technique used to
[help view things with "fresh eyes"][1] which can aid with [spotting
visual issues][2].

## Frequently asked questions

### Can't I just use any image editor to do what FlippyWindow does? 

As far as I'm aware, [Clip Paint Studio][6], [Krita][7], and [PaintTool
SAI][8] have features that allow you to non-destructively change how you
view an image. I built FlippyWindow because I use Adobe's [Creative
Cloud suite][9] which lacks such features.

FlippyWindow can also help you spot visual issues in work outside of
image editors, including animations, application user interfaces, and
website designs.

### Will Linux and macOS be supported?

Not at the moment.
